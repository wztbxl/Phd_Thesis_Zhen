  abstract      = {Quantum anomaly is a fundamental feature of chiral fermions. In chiral materials the microscopic anomaly leads to nontrivial macroscopic transport processes such as the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME), which has been in the spotlight lately across disciplines of physics. The quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in relativistic nuclear collisions provides the unique example of a chiral material consisting of intrinsically relativistic chiral fermions. Potential discovery of CME in QGP is of utmost significance, with extensive experimental searches carried out over the past decade. A decisive new collider experiment, dedicated to detecting CME in the collisions of isobars, was performed in 2018 with analysis now underway. In this paper, we develop the state-of-the-art theoretical tool for describing CME phenomenon in these collisions and propose an appropriate isobar subtraction strategy for best background removal. Based on that, we make quantitative predictions for signatures of CME in the collisions of isobars. A new and robust observable that is independent of axial charge uncertainty -- the ratio between isobar-subtracted $\gamma-$ and $\delta-$ correlators, is found to be $- ( 0.41 \pm 0.27 )$ for event-plane measurement and $ - ( 0.90 \pm 0.45 )$ for reaction-plane measurement.},

This microscopic transport model describes the phenomenology of hadronic interactions at low and intermediate energies (<5 GeV) in terms of interactions between known hadrons and their resonances. At higher energies, >5 GeV, the excitation of colour strings and their subsequent fragmentation into hadrons dominates the multiple production of particles in the UrQMD model. The model shows a fair overall agreement with a large body of experimental h-h data over a wide range of h-h centre-of-mass energies. Hadronic reaction data with higher precision would be useful to support the use of the UrQMD model for relativistic heavy-ion collisions.}

The difference Δγ=γ(opposite-sign)−γ(same-sign) measures charge separation across the reaction plane, a predicted signal of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME). Although charge separation has been observed, it has been argued that the measured separation can also be explained by elliptic flow related backgrounds. In order to separate the two effects we perform measurements of the γ-correlator where background expectations differ from magnetic field driven effects. A differential measurement of γ with the relative pseudorapidity (Δη) between the first and second particles indicate that Δγ in peripheral A+A and p+A collisions are dominated by short-range correlations in Δη. However, a relatively wider component of the correlation in Δη tends to vanish the same way as projected magnetic field as predicted by MC-Glauber simulations.}

  abstract      = {In this paper a pair of observables are proposed as alternative ways, by examining the fluctuation of net momentum-ordering of charged pairs, to study the charge separation induced by the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in relativistic heavy ion collisions. They are, the out-of-plane to in-plane ratio of fluctuation of the difference between signed balance functions measured in pair's rest frame, and the ratio of it to similar measurement made in the laboratory frame. Both observables have been studied with simulations including flow-related backgrounds, and for the first time, backgrounds that are related to resonance's global spin alignment. The two observables have similar positive responses to signal, and opposite, limited responses to identifiable backgrounds arising from resonance flow and spin alignment. Both observables have also been tested with two realistic models, namely, a multi-phase transport (AMPT) model and the anomalous-viscous fluid dynamics (AVFD) model. These two observables, when cross examined, will provide useful insights in the study of CME-induced charge separation.},

  abstract    = {The QCD phase diagram lies at the heart of what the RHIC Physics Program is all about. While RHIC has been operating very successfully at or close to its maximum energy for almost a decade, it has become clear that this collider can also be operated at lower energies down to 5 GeV without extensive upgrades. An exploration of the full region of beam energies available at the RHIC facility is imperative. The STAR detector, due to its large uniform acceptance and excellent particle identification capabilities, is uniquely positioned to carry out this program in depth and detail. The first exploratory beam energy scan (BES) run at RHIC took place in 2010 (Run 10), since several STAR upgrades, most importantly a full barrel Time of Flight detector, are now completed which add new capabilities important for the interesting physics at BES energies. In this document we discuss current proposed measurements, with estimations of the accuracy of the measurements given an assumed event count at each beam energy.},

  abstract    = {In ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions, correlations of particles with opposite quantum numbers provide insight into quark production mechanisms and time scales, collective motion, and re-scattering in the hadronic phase. The longitudinal and azimuthal widths of balance functions for charged kaons and charged pions are used to examine the two-wave quark production model proposed to explain quark-antiquark production within the QGP, which predicts a large increase in up and down quark pairs relative to strange quark pairs around the time of hadronization.

  abstract     = {In high-energy heavy-ion collisions, the correlations between the emitted particles can be used as a probe to gain insight into the charge creation mechanisms. In this Letter, we report the first results of such studies using the electric charge balance function in the relative pseudorapidity ($\Delta\eta$) and azimuthal angle ($\Delta\varphi$) in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=2.76$ TeV with the ALICE detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The width of the balance function decreases with growing centrality (i.e. for more central collisions) in both projections. This centrality dependence is not reproduced by HIJING, while AMPT, a model which incorporates strings and parton rescattering, exhibits qualitative agreement with the measured correlations in $\Delta\varphi$ but fails to describe the correlations in $\Delta\eta$. A thermal blast-wave model incorporating local charge conservation and tuned to describe the $p_{\rm T}$ spectra and v$_2$ measurements reported by ALICE, is used to fit the centrality dependence of the width of the balance function and to extract the average separation of balancing charges at freeze-out. The comparison of our results with measurements at lower energies reveals an ordering with $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$: the balance functions become narrower with increasing energy for all centralities. This is consistent with the effect of larger radial flow at the LHC energies but also with the late stage creation scenario of balancing charges. However, the relative decrease of the balance function widths in $\Delta\eta$ and $\Delta\varphi$ with centrality from the highest SPS to the LHC energy exhibits only small differences. This observation cannot be interpreted solely within the framework where the majority of the charge is produced at a later stage in the evolution of the heavy--ion collision.},

Basing on topological considerations, we derive a lower bound on the magnitude of the expected asymmetry, which may appear within the reach of the current and/or future heavy ion experiments.}

Configurations with non-zero Qw break the charge-parity (CP) symmetry of QCD. We consider a novel mechanism by which these configurations can separate charge in the presence of a background magnetic field—the “chiral magnetic effect”. We argue that sufficiently large magnetic fields are created in heavy ion collisions so that the chiral magnetic effect causes preferential emission of charged particles along the direction of angular momentum. Since separation of charge is CP-odd, any observation of the chiral magnetic effect could provide a clear demonstration of the topological nature of the QCD vacuum. We give an estimate of the effect and conclude that it might be observed experimentally.}

We present the detailed model implementation, accompanied by some numerical code tests for the package. iEBE-VISHNU forms the core of a general theoretical framework for model-data comparisons through large scale Monte-Carlo simulations. A numerical interface between the hydrodynamically evolving medium and thermal photon radiation is also discussed. This interface is more generally designed for calculations of all kinds of rare probes that are coupled to the temperature and flow velocity evolution of the bulk medium, such as jet energy loss and heavy quark diffusion.

Computer: Laptop, desktop, cluster. Operating system: Tested on GNU/Linux Ubuntu 12.04 x64, Red Hat Linux 6, Mac OS X 10.8+. RAM: 2G bytes Classification: 17.11, 17.16, 17.20. External routines: GNU Scientific Library (GSL), HDF5 (Fortran and C++ enabled), Numpy Nature of problem: Relativistic heavy-ion collisions are tiny in size (V≈10−42m3) and live in a flash (∼5×10−23s). It is impossible to use external probes to study the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), a novel state of matter created during the collisions. Experiments can only measure the momentum information of stable hadrons, who are the remnants of the collisions. In order to extract the thermal and transport properties of the QGP one needs to rely on Monte-Carlo event-by-event model simulations, which reverse-engineer the experimental measurements to the early time dynamics of the relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Solution method: Relativistic heavy-ion collisions contain multiple stages of evolution. The physics that governs each stage is implemented into individual code components. A general driver script glues all the modular packages as a whole to perform large-scale Monte-Carlo simulations. The final results are stored into SQLite database, which supports standard querying for massive data analysis. By tuning transport coefficients of the QGP as free parameters, e.g. the specific shear viscosity η/s, we can constrain various transport properties of the QGP through model-data comparisons. Additional comments: !!!!! The distribution file for this program is over 260 Mbytes and therefore is not delivered directly when download or Email is requested. Instead a html file giving details of how the program can be obtained is sent. !!!!!

HFT utilizes the state-of-art active pixel detector technology, which will greatly enhance the STAR physics capabilities by measuring heavy quark yield, collectivity and correlations via the topological reconstruction of charmed hadrons over a wide momentum range. The MTD is based on the long Multi-Gap Resistive Plate Chamber detector technology designed to measure muons penetrating the bulk of other detectors and the magnet yoke. It will enable STAR to study di-muon and electron-muon correlations and enhance heavy quarkonium studies. With the addition of these upgrades, STAR is well suited to perform precise measurements of production as well as correlations of rare probes (heavy flavors, dileptons) to systematically investigate the quark-gluon plasma properties at RHIC. For Run 13 63% of the MTD has been installed and data have been taken. Prototype PXL sectors (30% coverage) have also been installed and commissioned. Anticipated physics results and current status of these upgrades is reported.}

To match the high multiplicity of central Au+Au collisions at RHIC the double-sided silicon strip technology was chosen which makes the SSD a half-million channels detector. Dedicated electronics have been designed for both readout and control. Also a novel technique of bonding, the Tape Automated Bonding, was used to fulfill the large number of bounds to be done. All aspects of the SSD are shortly described here and test performances of produced detection modules as well as simulated results on hit reconstruction are given.}

abstract = {The Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment is being planned at the international research center FAIR, under realization next to the GSI laboratory in Darmstadt, Germany. Its physics programme addresses the QCD phase diagram in the region of highest net baryon densities. Of particular interest are the expected first order phase transition from partonic to hadronic matter, ending in a critical point, and modifications of hadron properties in the dense medium as a signal of chiral symmetry restoration. Laid out as a fixed-target experiment at the heavy-ion synchrotrons SIS-100/300, the detector will record both proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions at beam energies between 10 and 45A GeV. Hadronic, leptonic and photonic observables have to be measured with large acceptance. The interaction rates will reach 10 MHz to measure extremely rare probes like charm near threshold. Two versions of the experiment are being studied, optimized for either electron-hadron or muon identification, combined with silicon detector based charged-particle tracking and micro-vertex detection. The CBM physics requires the development of novel detector systems, trigger and data acquisition concepts as well as innovative real-time reconstruction techniques. Progress with feasibility studies of the CBM experiment and the development of its detector systems are reported.}

General arguments are given which confirm that the angular momentum of QCD matter in the presence of nonzero topological charge should induce an electric field aligned along the axis of the angular momentum. A simple formula relating the magnitude of charge asymmetry to the angular momentum and topological charge is derived. The expected asymmetry is amenable to experimental observation at RHIC and LHC; we discuss the recent preliminary STAR result in light of our findings. Possible implications of charge separation phenomenon in cosmology and astrophysics are discussed as well.}

We report measurements by the STAR collaboration of a CME-sensitive observable in p+Au and d+Au collisions at 200 GeV, where the CME is not expected, using charge-dependent pair correlations relative to a third particle. We observe strong charge-dependent correlations similar to those measured in heavy-ion collisions. This bears important implications for the interpretation of the heavy-ion data.}

abstract = {The chiral magnetic effect (CME) refers to charge separation along a strong magnetic field between left- and right-handed quarks, caused by interactions with topological gluon fields from QCD vacuum fluctuations. We present two approaches to handle the dominant elliptic flow (v2) background in the three-particle correlator (Δγ112), sensitive to CME. In the first approach, we present the Δγ112 and Δγ123 measurements in U+U and Au+Au collisions. While hydrodynamic simulations including resonance decays and local charge conservation predict that Δγ112 scaled by Npart/ν2 will be similar in U+U and Au+Au collisions, the projected B-field exhibits a distinct difference between the two systems and with varying Npart. Therefore, U+U and Au+Au collisions provide configurations with different expectations for both CME signal and background. Moreover, the three-particle observable Δγ123 scaled by Npart/ν3 provide baseline measurement for only the background. In the second approach, we handle the ν2 background by measuring Δγ112 with respect to the planes of spectators measured by Zero Degree Calorimeters and participants measured by Time Projection Chamber. These measurements contain different amounts of contributions from CME signal (along B-field, due to spectators) and ν2 background (determined by the participant geometry). With the two Δγ112 measurements, the possible CME signal and the background contribution can be determined. We report such a measurement in Au+Au collisions at sNN=27GeV with the newly installed event plane detector, and report the new findings in U+U system where the spectator-participant plane correlations are expected to differ from those in Au+Au collisions.}

The v2 of pions from resonance particle decays is found to be similar to the measured pion v2. We also propose the measurement of electron v2 as a means to extract open-charm v2 and investigate whether a thermalized system of quasi-free quarks and gluons (a quark–gluon plasma) is created in collisions of Au nuclei at RHIC.}

The objective is to provide as accurate as possible a representation of event properties in a wide range of reactions, within and beyond the Standard Model, with emphasis on those where strong interactions play a rôle, directly or indirectly, and therefore multihadronic final states are produced. The physics is then not understood well enough to give an exact description; instead the program has to be based on a combination of analytical results and various QCD-based models. This physics input is summarized here, for areas such as hard subprocesses, initial- and final-state parton showers, underlying events and beam remnants, fragmentation and decays, and much more. Furthermore, extensive information is provided on all program elements: subroutines and functions, switches and parameters, and particle and process data. This should allow the user to tailor the generation task to the topics of interest.

The code and further information may be found on the Pythia web page: http://www.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/Pythia.html.}

	journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
	abstract = {The STAR collaboration is currently pursuing the blind analysis of the data for isobar collisions that was performed at RHIC in the year 2018 to make a decisive test of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME). Why is it so difficult to detect signals of CME in the experiment? Do we really understand different sources of background? Why observing similar charge separation between p/d + A and A + A does not stop us from pursuing the search for CME? In this contribution, I attempt to address some of these questions and briefly outline a few recent STAR analyses based on new methods and observables to isolate the possible CME-driven signal and non-CME background contributions at the top RHIC energy. Finally, I describe the procedure for the blind analysis of the isobar data. An outstanding question remains – what happens if we go down in energy? I address this by discussing how the new event-plane detector (EPD) upgrade provides a new capability at STAR towards CME search using the data from the RHIC BES-II program.}
